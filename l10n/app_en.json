In my experience, this app has turned out to be the most reliable and accurate of all that I have used to date. Each update is welcome because of refined performance and acuracy of the app. Unlike other apps that I have used to test download and upload speed, this app has not disappointed. Having been an IT professional for some 30 years, primarily in data warehousing/big data, I can say that this app is quite valuable for me in determining potential performance issues, when working remotely.}}",
